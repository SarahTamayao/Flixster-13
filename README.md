### Notes
I faced some challenges while making this application. I wrote the entire code and my application was running but nothing was popping up on the filxter screen. When I debugged, I found out that my activity_main.xml file had an issue. In this file, I did not set the android layout_width and andorid layout_height to "match parent" instead they were set to 0dps. Once, I corrected this issue my application ran fine.
